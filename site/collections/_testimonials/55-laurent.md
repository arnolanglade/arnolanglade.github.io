blurb: It was my pleasure to work in pair-programming with Arnaud for 3 months. His mastery of TDD and his ability to guide his teammates into it made the whole experience extremely profitable and allowed to produce a very well-decoupled, expressive code.
  We could rely a lot on his ability to split a big feature into smaller steps, without being confused by the general complexity of the task at hand.
  Finally, his constant focus on building iteratively things that work and bring value make him a 5* asset in a software development team.
