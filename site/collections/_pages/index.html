      <p>
        I am a software architect, and technical coach. I focus on understanding business needs to find the best solution. I love everything that ends with *DD such as DDD, BDD and TDD. These tools and all eXtreme Programming values help me to build robust and maintainable software. Last but not least, teamwork is essential: «alone we go faster, together we go further».
