Nous avons souvent évolué sur des projets différents, mais avons eu quelques occasions de travailler ensemble, notamment sur des démarrages de projets Symfony où l'expertise d'Arnaud était très appréciée, puisqu'il était capable de comprendre les problématiques métiers que nous rencontrions et de nous proposer la juste couche d'abstraction pour y répondre, afin de partir sur une architecture logicielle dont la complexité était adaptée. Si l'occasion venait à ne présenter, je travaillerais à nouveau avec Arnaud avec plaisir, et confiance."
