description: "Talk at Agile tour Bordeaux : I present to you what I have learned over the last few years to help you write tests. When I started coding I could develop for hours without executing my code. Then, I needed to debug it for hours. It wasn't funny! I discovered what was testing and I understood its benefits."
abstract: "I remember when I first started coding, I could spend hours writing code without running it. The fun part ended there, as I had then to spend hours debugging it. Later on, I discovered testing and quickly realized the benefits it offered. However, writing my first tests was not easy. It's easy to make many mistakes that make them difficult to write and maintain. I want to share what I've learned over the years to make writing your tests easier."
