description: "Talk at Agile Touraine Tech 2025: In this presentation, I explain the limitations of anemic models and how to design rich, business-oriented models using the tactical patterns of Domain-Driven Design (DDD)"
abstract: "A CRUD is simple and fast. But is it enough to build any application? Spoiler alert: no.

A few years ago, I joined the core team of Sylius, an open-source project where I mainly contributed to developing a tool that simplified CRUD management. At the time, I was working in a web agency, and this tool helped me move fast. But when I joined Akeneo, a software company, I quickly realized that CRUD wasn’t enough.

In this talk, I’ll share the challenges I faced with CRUD and explain how to design rich, business-oriented models using the tactical patterns of Domain-Driven Design (DDD)."
