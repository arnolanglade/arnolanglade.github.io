description: "Talk at the Afup Day 2024 : Symfony provides a rich library of components that help avoid reinventing the wheel. Thanks to Symfony, I have been able to create several applications by focusing on business issues rather than technical details. However, it is essential to design an application well to ensure easy evolution and maintenance. During this presentation, I will show you how I designed the architecture of my applications using only a few Symfony components and applying patterns such as hexagonal architecture and CQRS."
