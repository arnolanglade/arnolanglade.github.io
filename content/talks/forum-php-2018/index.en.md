description: "Conférence at Forum PHP : I explain what is the repository pattern and how to design it thanks to Doctrine. I gave some tips to query data without struggling with the ORM."
abstract: "What is a repository? The repository pattern is one of the most commonly used patterns in our applications. Although simple and handy, it is too often misused: our repositories are more frequently warehouses of SQL queries rather than “true” repositories. During this talk, we will see how to design a repository and manage our SQL queries."
