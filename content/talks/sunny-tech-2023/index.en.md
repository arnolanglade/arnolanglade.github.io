description: "Talk at Sunny tech: I explain and share tips about how to run an example mapping. Example mapping is a good way to align the team's understanding of domain problems and help your team to better collaborate. Last but not least, it eases to refine your stories and improve your backlog prioritization."
abstract: "For many years, I've been setting up for topics with these long and boring grooming sessions. It was super hard to keep focused all the way through. A meeting that just keeps going doesn't really help in getting the team on the same page or in understanding what's expected. And remember, like Alberto Brandolini used to say, it's the misunderstanding among developers that ends up being shipped. In this talk, I'm gonna tell you about a workshop called 'Example Mapping.' This workshop will make it super easy for you to talk about what's needed and put together your backlog as a team."
