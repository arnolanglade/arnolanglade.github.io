description: "Talk at PHP Tour : I explain how to refactor an application that uses anaemic models to rich models. I introduce some design patterns like the repository, handling use cases with a command handler and the basics of CQRS."
abstract: "Will we be talking about human resources management at the PHP tour? No, I'm going to talk to you about anemic models and rich models. For years, frameworks and ORMs have conditioned us to use anemic models, a class with simple setters and getters. Through the story of Estelle, an HR manager who wants an application to manage her employees, I will show you how to change our old habits to focus on the business logic we are implementing. We will see together which tools to use, such as the command bus design pattern, the NEW operator from Doctrine for your Data Transfer Objects in a Symfony application."
