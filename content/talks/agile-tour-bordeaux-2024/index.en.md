description: "Conference at Agile tour Nantes 2024 : In this presentation, I’ll share how we replaced these meetings with a much more productive workshop: Example Mapping. Thanks to this simple and effective tool, we managed to clarify requirements and build our backlog collaboratively."
abstract: "Are you tired of meetings that seem to go nowhere? I have often felt this frustration during product refinement sessions. These meetings would often turn into endless debates, making it very challenging to stay focused until the end.

As Alberto Brandolini says, “it’s the misunderstanding of developers that goes into production.” If developers do not understand what is expected, there’s a high chance the delivered features will be incorrect.

In this presentation, I’ll share how we replaced these meetings with a much more productive workshop: Example Mapping. Thanks to this simple and effective tool, we managed to clarify requirements and build our backlog collaboratively."
