I am a software architect, and technical coach with 15 years of experience. I am, what we call, a self-taught. I studied telecommunications and networks at school but my first job was in a small web agency as a developer. I learned on the job and improved my skills by myself for many years during my free time. I did not take the easiest path but I don’t have any regrets. I love my job!

I worked with many service companies that allowed me to  work on big projects for huge companies like [Prisma media](https://www.prismamedia.com), [Royal Canin](https://www.royalcanin.com) and [Groupe Sud Ouest](https://www.groupesudouest.com). Then, I worked for several startups like [Akeneo](https://www.akeneo.com), [Convelio](https://www.convelio.com) or [Sunday](https://sundayapp.com). Finally, I started my own enterprise in August 2022 after leaving Sunday.

Software is valuable only if it is used and solves business's needs. That’s why I focus on understanding the business first. I organize and animate event storming and example mapping workshops. Both workshops aim to gather tech and non-tech in the same room and let them speak. Event storming helps to grasp the global picture and start thinking about the software design while example mapping helps to clarify user stories.

I focus my technical watch on topics that let me build robust and maintainable software. I develop using TDD and the mikado method. Those methodologies help me to design features baby step by baby step while covering code with tests. I am not interested in the latest super cool technologies. I prefer learning architecture patterns such as hexagonal architecture, it lets me build software no matter the frameworks.

I try to find the simplest solution that solves a business problem to ship it to production as quickly as possible. Any feedback is key in software development, it ensures we take the right decision. Agile, «This is the way».
