I am a technical coach and software architect with 15 years of experience. Self-taught, I studied telecommunications and networks in school, my first job was in a small web agency as a developer. I learned on the job and spent many years enhancing my skills in my free time. It wasn't the easiest path, but I have no regrets. I love my job!

I have worked with many service companies, which allowed me to contribute on major projects for huge companies such as [Prisma media](https://www.prismamedia.com), [Royal Canin](https://www.royalcanin.com) and [Groupe Sud Ouest](https://www.groupesudouest.com). Then, I worked for several startups, including [Akeneo](https://www.akeneo.com), [Convelio](https://www.convelio.com) or [Sunday](https://sundayapp.com). Finally, after leaving Sunday, I founded my own enterprise in August 2022.

Software is valuable only if it is used and meets the needs of a business. That's why I focus on understanding the business first. I organize and facilitate event storming and example mapping workshops. Both workshops aim to gather technical and non-technical stakeholders in the same room to facilitate discussion. Event storming helps to grasp the global picture and start thinking about the software design, while example mapping helps to clarify user stories.

I focus my technical watch on topics that enable me to build robust and maintainable software. I develop using TDD (Test-Driven Development) and the Mikado Method. These methodologies help me to design features step by step while ensuring the code is well tested. I am not interested in the latest, super-cool technologies. Instead, I prefer learning about architectural patterns, such as hexagonal architecture, because they allow me to build software regardless of the frameworks used.

I try to find the simplest solution that solves a business problem, aiming to ship it to production as quickly as possible. Feedback is important in software development, it ensures we make the right decisions. Agile, «This is the way»
