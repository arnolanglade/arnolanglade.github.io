      With 15 years as a software engineer, I've collaborated with large companies like Royal Canin (a Mars Group company), Prisma Media, Sud Ouest Group, and innovative startups such as Akeneo, Convelio, and Sunday. My priority? Delivering real value to end users.
  
      I believe in the power of understanding business needs over chasing the latest tech trends. I focus on finding the most pragmatic solutions to quickly ship them to production and collect user feedback.. Feedback is crucial in software development, it ensures we make the right decisions.

      Are bad habits slowing down your delivery capabilities? If you want change but discussions always turn into an endless debate, sometimes bringing in an external facilitator can make all the difference. 
  
      As a Technical Coach, I can help your teams grow, enhancing their efficiency and productivity. I love sharing my knowledge on software craftsmanship and helping the individuals I collaborate with to progress.

      Adding tens and tens of software engineers but still not shipping fast enough? Simply hiring more people isn't the key to scaling effectively. When an engineer updates one section of the application and it unexpectedly affects another, this suggests architecture issues within your application.

      I've worked for several startups, so I'm familiar with this problem. As software architect, I can help you build solid software foundations and organize your teams to enable faster feature delivery.

      Often find yourself shipping features that don't meet business expectations? As Alberto Brandolini said :  “It's not stakeholder knowledge but developers' ignorance that gets deployed into production.”
  
      To bridge this gap, I can organize and lead event storming and example mapping workshops. These sessions are designed to bring technical and non-technical stakeholders together in one room to facilitate discussion. Event storming helps to grasp the global picture and start thinking about the software design, while example mapping helps to clarify user stories.
